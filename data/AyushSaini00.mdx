## Do Epic Shit - Ankur Warikoo

My initial thoughts on this book just by hearing the name "DO EPIC SHIT" were like the author's going to tell his stories of success & how he reached to the point in life where he's now & how the readers can learn to achieve of find their own success, but the book is so much more than that & goes beyond what i'd imagined. Here are the 3 points from the book that I related the most & think that will help in me in becoming a better version of me & be more aware :

- you are what you do, not what you say you'll do 14
- we have one life, why live it with just one identity 17
- you don't follow your passion, you grow your passion 31
- fighting the sterotype is a great way to get attention 38
- while you're building your skills, the most important thing to build is your reputation 42
- everyone is running a different race, in fact.. 50
- if you don't ask the answer is always no 50
- 90% of people wants to be led 58
- accomplishments are like a 0 to 1 transition. People know you transitioned from 0 to 1 but what they don't know about those intermediatory steps in between that managed you to transition. From their perspective the jurney was a one big change, from 0 to 1, from yours it was a large number of small wins & failures just like how 0 & 1 have infinite numbers between them if you observe them on real scale. 
- before you asume try this crazy thing ask 84
- we are shaped by the stories we tell ourselves 92
- we know others through their actions, we know ourselves throught our thoughts 93
- do not allow comfort to make you believe that you no longer need to try. 100
- if you follow the right set of people on social media, opportunities will come by design, not by luck! 105
- even a tiny improvement in your productivity will yield results over time 113
- if unsure between two choices, picking both is almost the wrong response. 123
- your self talk determines your self worth. 129
- not making a decision because you're scared of making the wrong decision? 130
- if you're not having fun while doing it, people will see through it. happiness & fun is a language that communicates trhough your face and your eyes. 133
- knowing when to say no and saying it is a life skill.
- it is better to be busy in the chase of finding yourself instead of being busy in the rat race and never know yourself. 139
- the distance between "i could have" and "i have" is regret. 151
- instead of worrying about what might happen, anticipate what might happen. 156
- being grateful in life for what you have is precious, let go your ego 159
- only when you go against the flow will you find your own flow. 167
- don't ever fool yourself to believe you deserve to be where you are in life. 171
- if you are not showing up every day, it's not going to work, be it in work, life & relationships.
- keep reminding yourself why you decided to do something because after a certain point, the stories you tell yourself are going to be the only one thing that will help you move forward. 179
- if you can't be trusted, it doesn't matter how smart you are when it comes to work (or even life) 182
- No one knows all the answers, so instead of focusing on knowing everything, focus on doing everything you can do in your capacity to find the unknown. 187
- money buys freedom, freedom is a privilege. don't give up your freedom to earn money. 205/218
- we often don't value our time, we procastinate stuff by telling us that we have free time, the only thing isn't free is your time. 214
- our income isn't capped, there is no upper bound to how much we can earn. instead of reducing expenses, focus on increasing your income. 215
- every problem in this world can be traced back to a point of miscommunication.
- respect >> empathy >> sympathy. 243
- no one is useless. everyone knows something you don't. knowing that you don't know much, is the best knowledge!!! 244
- run away from those who are trying to run away from themselves. 247
- it takes effort to find love, to feel fulfilled, to be fit & happy, which is why most of us do not have some of these in our life. 251
- how we treat others is a reflection of how we treat ourselves. the inner world drives the outer. 261
- we are avg of the 5 thoughts we spend the most time with. our thoughts come from things we consume online or offline. we are not with people anymore. we are with ideas, thoughts and identities. 262
- if you do not believe in yourself, no one else will. 266
